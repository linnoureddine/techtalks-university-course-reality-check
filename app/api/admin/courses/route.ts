/**
 * GET /api/admin/courses
 *
 * Returns ALL courses (including soft-deleted) so the frontend can show them
 * with an "opacity-50 / Deleted" style and let the status filter work in-memory.
 *
 * Filtering by university, department, level, language, and status is handled
 * by the frontend useMemo — matching how the page is built.
 *
 * Query params:
 *   q     — search across code, title, department name, university name
 *   sort  — rating_high | rating_low | reviews_most  (default: rating_high)
 *
 * Response shape matches the Course type in the frontend exactly:
 * {
 *   course_id, code, title, description, credits, level, language,
 *   department_id, department, university_id, university, deleted_at,
 *   rating, number_of_reviews,
 *   metrics: { exam, workload, attendance, grading }
 * }

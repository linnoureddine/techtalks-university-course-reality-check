# University Course Reality Check Platform

## Overview

Official university course descriptions often fail to reflect the real student experience.  
This platform allows students to **anonymously share honest feedback** about university courses — including workload grading fairness, exam difficulty, and attendance strictness.
Future students can make **informed decisions** instead of choosing courses blindly.

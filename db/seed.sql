For each system, we move from analysis to synthesis of circuits using different methods. Part of the lab work takes place around the Quartus II tool which allows students to implement digital circuits in a schematic or descriptive form and to simulate and analyze the circuits with signals and practical considerations. The other part of the lab work is reserved for the practical creation of digital circuits using integrated circuits on a breadboard to allow students to discover electronic components and their wiring.',
